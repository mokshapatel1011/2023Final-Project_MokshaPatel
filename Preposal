## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

Ideas:
- Create a program or software that allows you to use information from Chat GPT and repeat it back to you (Basically like an Alexa)
  You can use this and add different features to it like…
           - Weather updates 
           - Calculator 
- Use facial recognition and then create a basic filter over the person’s face 
- Snake game but instead of apples there will be other animals (bunnies and mice) which will also be moving around. Eating a bunny is worth more points than eating the mouse.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

I plan to work alone.

## Do you have any questions of your own?

Not currently.
